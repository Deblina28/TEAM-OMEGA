# Smart Vendor
If one is to search for some sort of refreshment or emergency needs on their way, people rarely
find an option of doing so on or near highways. Smart Vendor is an IOT based customizable
vending machine that will promote buying and selling on highways so that people can avail such
products when enroute.
By installing ‘Smart Vendor' in highway Wayside Amenities (WSAs), several enterprises will be
able to sell their product(s) to a wide number of customers in different locations without having
manual labour to be present there at all times.
In upcoming days, ‘Smart Vendor’ will be able to serve people with beverages, snacks, meals,
etc. while they rest or wait for refueling/ recharging of their vehicles.
